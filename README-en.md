# WeChat Bot 🤖

The WeChat Bot is a project developed based on Python 3.11, utilizing API calls to leverage WeChat's native capabilities and integrating with artificial intelligence to assist users in accomplishing a range of tasks. These tasks include, but are not limited to, replying to admired girls with high EQ, creating avatars, AI painting, and completing multiple API processes through text (such as obtaining weather, generating images based on weather, and automatically posting to Moments, etc.).

## Frequently Asked Questions

- **How to Fill in the Values in JSON**

  - After starting the program, wait for the message callback, and fill in other values in the json after receiving callback messages in groups or from friends
- **ChatGPT does not support GPTs API, how did you do it**
  - There are some vendors providing openai proxy services, who have cracked openai's API to offer GPTs API services at a cheaper price than the official one
- **I'm not tech-savvy, how can I get the project running**
  - Our newly hired engineers are developing a functional interface, please give our interns some time.
